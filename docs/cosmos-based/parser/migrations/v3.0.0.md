This guide provides details for the upgrade from v2.0.0 to v3.0.0.  
If you are **NOT** using PostgreSQL database, you should <ins>only</ins> 
follow the steps described in the `Update branch to v3` section and skip the rest of the guide. 

## Update branch to v3
Pull the changes from `v3.0.0-stargate` (v0.42.x/stargate) or `v3.0.0` (v0.44.x and above) 
tag to your branch depending on the cosmos sdk version being used in your project. 

```
$ git fetch --tags
$ git checkout <your chain base>
$ git checkout -b merge/v3.0.0-stargate
$ git merge base-v3.0.0-stargate
```

Fix all merge conflicts and then install the latest BDJuno version 

```
$ make install
```

### Update service
If you are running BDJuno as a background service, you will need to update it before restarting. Edit `/etc/systemd/system/bdjuno.service` file and replace `parse` with `start` command at the ExecStart line. 
```shell
$ sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/bdjuno.service
```
```
[Unit]
Description=BDJuno parser
After=network-online.target

[Service]
User=$USER
ExecStart=$GOPATH/bin/bdjuno start
Restart=always
RestartSec=3
LimitNOFILE=4096

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```


:warning:  **Do __NOT__ restart BDJuno yet if you're using PostgreSQL** 
 **database and you are going to perform table migration. Proceed to the next step instead.**  
  
If you are not using the PostgreSQL database you can now start BDJuno 
```
$ bdjuno start
```
or if you are running it as a background service run
```shell
$ sudo systemctl restart bdjuno.service
```


## Migration to PostgreSQL table partitioning
In order to efficiently query the database with large amount of transactions and messages,
we've implemented PostgreSQL [Table Partitioning](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/10/ddl-partitioning.html) 
feature starting from `v3.0.0` which turns the `transaction` and `message` tables into 
partitioned tables and creates partitions by a certain interval of heights set inside 
[config.yaml file](./../config/config.md#database). 

### Prepare for the migration
1. Add custom address parser inside `bdjuno/database/migrate/utils.go` file, 
or leave it empty if no custom address parser is needed. 
```go
// If no custom address parser
var CustomAccountParser = []string{}
```
```go
// Take desmos chain as example:
var CustomAccountParser = []string{
  "sender", "receiver", "user", "counterparty", "blocker", "blocked",
}
```
2. Checkout inside the **/bdjuno** directory and run:
```shell
$ make install
$ bdjuno migrate v3
```
Two additional fields inside `.bdjuno/config.yaml` file will be created under the database section. 
Don't panic if you see the error message pops up: `partition batch size is set to 0, skipping migration`, 
because these 2 fields need to be modified before starting the migration, for example:
```yaml
database:
    # How many blocks for each partition. 
    # In this example partition is created per 100,000 blocks.
    partition_size: 100000
    
    # How many rows of transactions are migrated per batch 
    partition_batch: 1000 
```
Read [Database Config Reference](./../config/config.md#database) for more information.

### Start the migration
**Make sure BDJuno is stopped before the migration.**  
We recommend setting up the migration process as a system service and being patient 
as the migration might take some time, depending on the database size.

```shell
$ sudo tee /etc/systemd/system/bdjuno-migrate-v3.service > /dev/null <<EOF
[Unit]
Description=BDJuno Table Partition Migration v3
After=network-online.target

[Service]
User=$USER
ExecStart=$GOPATH/bin/bdjuno migrate v3
LimitNOFILE=4096

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
EOF
```

Then you need to enable and start the service:
```shell 
$ sudo systemctl enable bdjuno-migrate-v3.service
$ sudo systemctl start bdjuno-migrate-v3.service
```

BDJuno will now start migration which will:  
- rename `transaction` & `message` tables to `transaction_old` & `message_old`  
- rename related transaction and message indexes; 
- create new `transaction` & `message` tables with partition;
- create indexes for new transaction and message table  
- migrate rows with data by batch from old to new tables;
- drop old function `messages_by_address` and create a new one;

While the migration is ongoing, you can already restart BDJuno to start 
syncing the latest data and it will be stored inside new partitioned tables:
```shell
$ bdjuno start
```

### Hasura
Since v3, Hasura actions' handlers can use custom enpoints other than `http://localhost:3000`. 
Hasura will read from the `ACTION_BASE_URL` environmental variable as the action handler's base URL. 
To update so, you will need to re-create a new docker container, specifying the variable with `-e` flag:
```
-e ACTION_BASE_URL="Base URL for Hasura Actions Handlers"
```
For more details, check [Installing Hasura](../hasura.md#installing-hasura)

You will also need to re-apply hasura metadata to match the latest table setup:
```shell
$ cd /path/to/bdjuno/hasura
$ hasura metadata apply --endpoint <your-endpoint> --admin-secret <hasura_password>
```


### Migration completed
Once all transactions and messages have been migrated to new partitioned tables the migration is completed. For the safety reasons 
it does __not__ drop old tables `transaction_old` and `message_old`. 
You might want to drop them after the data consistency is verified and they are no longer needed.   
```sql
DROP TABLE transaction_old;
DROP TABLE message_old;
```


### Revert
In any case that the migration fails, you can always revert the changes without losing any data. 
You might find the below SQL script helpful for altering tables and indexes back to the original names. 
Remember to drop the new `transaction` and `message` tables, along with the messages_by_address function.

**Please ensure BDJuno is stopped prior to running the script.** 
```sql
ALTER TABLE transaction_old RENAME TO transaction;
ALTER INDEX transaction_old_pkey RENAME TO transaction_pkey;
ALTER INDEX transaction_old_hash_index RENAME TO transaction_hash_index;
ALTER INDEX transaction_old_height_index RENAME TO transaction_height_index;
ALTER TABLE transaction RENAME CONSTRAINT transaction_old_height_fkey TO transaction_height_fkey;

ALTER TABLE message_old RENAME TO message;
ALTER INDEX message_old_involved_accounts_addresses RENAME TO message_involved_accounts_addresses;
ALTER INDEX message_old_transaction_hash_index RENAME TO message_transaction_hash_index;
ALTER INDEX message_old_type_index RENAME TO message_type_index;
ALTER TABLE message RENAME CONSTRAINT message_old_transaction_hash_fkey TO message_transaction_hash_fkey;

CREATE FUNCTION messages_by_address(
    addresses TEXT[],
    types TEXT[],
    "limit" BIGINT = 100,
    "offset" BIGINT = 0)
    RETURNS SETOF message AS
$$
SELECT message.transaction_hash, message.index, message.type, message.value, message.involved_accounts_addresses
FROM message
         JOIN transaction t on message.transaction_hash = t.hash
WHERE (cardinality(types) = 0 OR type = ANY (types))
  AND addresses && involved_accounts_addresses
ORDER BY height DESC
LIMIT "limit" OFFSET "offset"
$$ LANGUAGE sql STABLE;
```

When the tables are altered back, install and run your previous BDJuno branch which 
will continue to parse the data from the height before the migration started.
