This guide provides details for the upgrade from v1.0.0 to v2.0.0.  
Since the release of BDJuno `v2.0.0`, certain address-specific data is no longer periodically parsed from the node and stored in the database. 
Instead, the data is obtained directly from the node when necessary thanks to the [Hasura Actions](https://hasura.io/docs/latest/graphql/core/actions/index.html) service.

Here's the list of data which is acquired through Hasura Actions:
- Address/Delegator related data:
    - Account balance
    - Delegation rewards
    - Delegator withdraw address
    - Delegations
    - Total delegations amount
    - Unbonding delegations
    - Total unbonding delegations amount
    - Redelegations
- Validator related data: 
    - Commission amount
    - Validator delegations
    - Validator redelegations
    - Validator unbonding delegations

### Update branch to v2

Pull the changes from `v2.0.0-stargate` (v0.42.x/stargate) or `v2.0.0` (v0.44.x and above) 
tag to your branch depending on cosmos sdk version being used in your project. 

```
$ git fetch --tags
$ git checkout <your chain base>
$ git checkout -b merge/v2.0.0-stargate
$ git merge base-v2.0.0-stargate
```
Fix all merge conflicts and then install the latest BDJuno version 

```
$ make install
```

### Start Hasura Actions

To activate Hasura actions, simply run: 
```
$ bdjuno hasura-actions
```

By default hasura-actions will listen to rpc and grpc on `127.0.0.1:26657` and `127.0.0.1:9090` ports. To pass custom address run

```
$ bdjuno hasura-actions --rpc <custom-rpc-address> --grpc <custom grpc address>
```

It is also recommended to run Hasura Actions as a system service:
```shell
$ sudo tee /etc/systemd/system/hasura-actions.service > /dev/null <<EOF
[Unit]
Description=BDJuno Hasura Actions
After=network-online.target

[Service]
User=$USER
ExecStart=$GOPATH/bin/bdjuno hasura-actions
Restart=always
RestartSec=3
LimitNOFILE=4096

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
EOF
```

:::info Include flags
Remember to include your custom configurations as flags at the `ExecStart` line if any. 
Run `bdjuno hasura-actions --help` for more information.
:::

### Update hasura metadata
Change to hasura directory inside bdjuno repository and re-apply the metadata to include the hasura actions:
```
$ cd /path/to/bdjuno/hasura
$ hasura metadata apply --endpoint <your-endpoint> --admin-secret <hasura_password>
```

## Restart services
Restart the [bdjuno service](./../setup.md#running-bdjuno), and 
start the hasura actions service

```
$ sudo systemctl restart bdjuno
$ sudo systemctl start hasura-actions
```

Once the bdjuno and hasura actions are working properly, optionally
you could drop the below DB tables along with the functions which will no longer be updated in the latest BDJuno version:

#### Tables
- account_balance
- delegation
- redelegation
- unbonding_delegation
- delegators_to_refresh
- validator_commission_amount
- delegation_reward

#### Functions
- self_delegations
- is_delegation_self_delegate
- account_balance_tokens_prices
