Since the release of BDjuno ```v1.1.0```, certain address-specific data are no longer periodically parsed from the node and stored in the database. 
Instead, those data are obtained directly from the node when necessary thanks to the [Hasura Actions](https://hasura.io/docs/latest/graphql/core/actions/index.html) service.

Here's the list of data which are acquired through Hasura Actions:
- Of a certain address/delegator:
    - Account balance
    - Delegation rewards
    - Delegator withdraw address
    - Delegations
    - Total delegations amount
    - Unbonding delegations
    - Total unbonding delegations amount
    - Redelegations
- Of a certain validator:
    - Commission amount
    - Delegations to this validator
    - Redelegations from this validator
    - Unbonding delegations

## Update your chain's base branch
```
git fetch --tags
git checkout <your chain base>
git checkout -b merge/v1.1.0
```
### Merge tag according to your cosmos sdk base: 
For cosmos sdk v0.44.x and later:
```
git merge v1.1.0
```
For stargate:
```
git merge v1.1.0-stargate
```
Fix all merge conflicts.

## Update hasura metadata
Go to the hasura directory and re-apply the metadata to include the hasura actions:
```
cd bdjuno/hasura
hasura metadata apply --endpoint <your-endpoint> --admin-secret <hasura_password>
```

## Restart services
Make install, restart the [bdjuno service](../setup#running-bdjuno), and 
start the [hasura actions service](../hasura#start-hasura-actions). 

Once the bdjuno and hasura actions are working properly, optionally
you could drop the below DB tables which will no longer be updated by the new BDjuno along with the functions:

Tables: 
```
account_balance
delegation
redelegation
unbonding_delegation
delegators_to_refresh
validator_commission_amount
delegation_reward
```

Functions:
```
self_delegations
is_delegation_self_delegate
account_balance_tokens_prices
```
