# Overview

This section will provide a full documentation of how to setup Big Dipper using the frontend **Big Dipper UI** and the indexer **Soljuno** for **Solana**.

As we have broken Big Dipper into modular pieces with the goal of allowing users to be able to replace any of the components,
(you can use Soljuno without the UI and vice versa)
